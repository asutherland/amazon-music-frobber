The goal is that, given a search, to process Amazon's MP3 store and:
- Find the albums by that artist (reasonably easy, Amazon does this itself fairly well).
- Be able to tell the differences between the various deluxe/non-deluxe versions easily.
- Be able to find remixes on compilations that are not on the albums.
- Be able to find remixes by the artist of other artists' songs.
- Organize the display of albums/singles/collections by time/associated album/etc.
- Filter out all the spammy karaoke/cover/remake versions of things.

Right now we can:
- Scour pages of results and build an artist/album/track hierarchy, print it out.
